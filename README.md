# LibraryOfThoughts
This was built using Python, Django, and Bootstrap, and modified from a blog tutorial.  
I used it to get familiar with django.  
Original tutorial was a different version and required troubleshooting to implement most of the features. 

This website gives a place to enter thoughts and notes that can be referred back to as needed.  

Current Features: 
- There are admin and individual logins 
- Categories can be added 
- Thoughts can be seperated by category 
- Thoughts are arranged by newest to oldest on main page  

Features yet to be implemented: 
- Add subject as a clickable thing, (similar to categories). 
- Add sorting by subject  - Add navigation search bar that works  
- Arrange thoughts on category page by newest to oldest 
- Pin a thought to the top of main page and category page 
- Add edit and remove links on the categories page. 
- Add CSS or bootstrap formatting to increase aesthetics and readability. 
- Add a dropdown in the navigation bar on the category pages, like there is on all the other pages. (possibly with custom context processor to also remove repeated code on the views page)
